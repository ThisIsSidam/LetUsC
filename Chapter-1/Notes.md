- 3 top reasons for learning C:
	-  Good base for learning C++, C# or Java later.
	-  Unix, Linux, Windows, Gaming frameworks are written in C.
	-  Embedded systems programs are written in C.

- Constants = Literals -> Cannot change
- Variables = Identifiers -> May change

- Types of variables and constants : 
	1) Primary 
	2) Secondary

- 3 types in primary : 
	1) Integer 
	2) Real (float) 
	3) Character

- Ranges :
	 1) 2-byte integers : -32768 to 32767
	 2) 4-byte integers : -2147483648 to + 2147483647
	 3) floats : -3.4 x 10<sup>38</sup> to +3.4 x 10<sup>38</38> 

- In a char constant, both quotes must slant to the left.

- Variable has two meanings :
	- It is an entity whose value can change.
	- It is a name given to a location in memory.

- Variable names are case-sensitive and must begin with an alphabet.

- Total keywords = 32. Example char, int, float, etc.

- `printf()` is a function that can print multiple constants and variables.

- Format specifiers in `printf()`, `scanf()` :
	- int - `%d`
	- float - `%f`
	- char - `%c`

- `main()` is a function that must always return an integer value:
	- 0 - if it meets success.
	- 1 - if it encounters failure.

- `void main()` is wrong. Correct form is `int main()`.

- Use `/*.....*/` or `//` for a comment in a program.

- `&` is 'address of' operator and must be used before a variable in `scanf()`.
