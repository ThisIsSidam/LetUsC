## Found a Mistake?

If you found a mistake in my code, do contact me and I'll fix it up. You can also just send a pull request. Thinking why send a pull request for such a minor thing? Well, it can act as practice for you if you are new to sending pull requests (like me).

How to send a pull request?  Well you've gotta search it up on the net. Learn. The internet is all yours.
