- General form of decision control instructions: 
```
if (condition)
    statement1;
else 
    statement2;
```

- If there are several statements in `if-else` blocks, they must be enclosed within {}.
```
if (condition)
{
    statement1; statement2;
}
else 
{
    statement3; statement4;
}
```

- Condition is built using relation operators `<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`.

- An `if` need not always be associated with an `else`. However, an `else` must always be associated with an `if`.

- An `if-else` statement can be nested inside another `if-else` statement.

- `a=b` is assignment. `a==b` is comparison.

- In if `(a == b == c)` result of `a == b` is compared with `c`.

- If a condition is true it is replaced by `1`, if it is false it is replaced by `0`.

- `;` is a null statement. It doesn't do anything on execution.
